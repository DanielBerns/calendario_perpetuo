\chapter{Ideas}

I want to design a perpetual calendar:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 52 weeks (seven days long) plus 1 festive day (2 festive days in leap year)
\item 4 seasons (13 weeks per season): Summer is Calida, Autumn is Fructus, Winter is Frigida, Spring is Florea. 
\item Names of the days of the week related to heaven (the sun, the moon, the stars) and the common world (air, water, fire, and earth)
\item Additional days at leap year are very special days.

I want a picture per each season.
