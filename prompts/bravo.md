That is a brilliant and crucial point. You've hit upon the central challenge of creating a globally resonant calendar: a name that captures the essence of a period without being tied to one hemisphere's experience.

The key is to find names based on what is *fundamentally* happening during that 13-week period, focusing on astronomical events, archetypal concepts, or universal symbols that can be interpreted differently depending on where you live.

Let's call these 13-week periods **"Quarters"** or **"Turnings"** for a working title. Here are some naming systems for your four quarters.

### System 1: Astronomical & Phenological Names

These names are based on the path of the sun and the feeling of the natural world, described in a way that is neutral.

*   **First Quarter (Dec 21 -> Mar 21): The Deep Turning**
    *   **Why it works:** This period is defined by the winter solstice, the "turning of the sun." For the North, it's the deepest point of darkness, from which light begins its slow return. For the South, it's the peak of the sun's power, after which its intense heat begins to wane. "Deep" applies to both the cold and the heat, and "Turning" is the universal astronomical event.

*   **Second Quarter (Mar 21 -> Jun 21): The Surge**
    *   **Why it works:** This is a time of explosive energy. In the North, it's the surge of growth, greenery, and life. In the South, it's the final, powerful surge of heat before the cool, or the frantic energy of the final harvest. The word implies a powerful, forward-moving force that is present in both hemispheres.

*   **Third Quarter (Jun 21 -> Sep 21): The High Sun**
    *   **Why it works:** This is the most straightforward and neutral name. It is literally the time of the summer solstice, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. For the Southern Hemisphere, it is the time of the "Low Sun," but the period is still dominated by the sun's journey and its most extreme position. The name is a simple statement of astronomical fact.

*   **Fourth Quarter (Sep 21 -> Dec 21): The Fading**
    *   **Why it works:** This captures the sense of transition and decline. In the North, the light fades, the leaves fall, and the world prepares for its sleep. In the South, the oppressive heat fades, giving way to milder temperatures and the promise of the growing season. "Fading" beautifully describes the departure of the dominant season in both hemispheres.

### System 2: Mythological & Archetypal Names

These names use archetypes—the fundamental characters and stories of human experience—that can be applied to either hemisphere.

*   **First Quarter (Dec 21 -> Mar 21): The Time of Janus**
    *   **Why it works:** Janus is the Roman god of beginnings, endings, transitions, and doorways. He is depicted with two faces, one looking to the past and one to the future. This period is the ultimate threshold, the turning of the year. For the North, he looks back on the dark and forward to the light. For the South, he looks back on the peak of light and forward to the coming cool. He is the perfect symbol for this pivot point.

*   **Second Quarter (Mar 21 -> Jun 21): The Dance of the Maiden**
    *   **Why it works:** The Maiden (or Persephone returning, or Flora blooming) represents youth, new energy, and burgeoning life. In the North, this is the literal "dance" of spring. In the South, it can be seen as the last vibrant dance of life before the "death" of winter, or the joyful dance of a successful harvest.

*   **Third Quarter (Jun 21 -> Sep 21): The Reign of the Sun King**
    *   **Why it works:** The Sun King (like Apollo, Lugh, or Ra) represents power, authority, and the peak of masculine energy. In the North, his reign is benevolent and life-giving. In the South, his reign can be seen as tyrannical and harsh, a power to be endured. The duality of a king's reign—whether loved or feared—fits perfectly.

*   **Fourth Quarter (Sep 21 -> Dec 21): The Descent of the Queen**
    *   **Why it works:** This is the time of Persephone's descent into the Underworld. For the North, this is a literal descent into darkness and the death of the year. For the South, it is the Queen of Night (like Nyx) descending, bringing longer, more comfortable nights and ruling over a world that is now cool enough to plant and grow. It is a descent into mystery and potential.

### System 3: Constellation-Based Names

The stars are a universal constant. While different constellations are prominent, the mythology behind them can provide a shared story.

*   **First Quarter (Dec 21 -> Mar 21): The Hunter's Quarter**
    *   **Why it works:** This is the time of year when the magnificent constellation **Orion** is most dominant in the night sky for almost everyone on Earth. The Hunter is an archetype of survival, skill, and navigating the dark. For the North, this means surviving the cold. For the South, it means hunting and thriving during the long, warm nights.

*   **Second Quarter (Mar 21 -> Jun 21): The Lion's Quarter**
    *   **Why it works:** The constellation **Leo** the Lion is prominent during this period. The Lion is a universal symbol of strength, royalty, and solar power. This fits the North's growing, powerful sun. For the South, the Lion represents the fierce, majestic strength of the land at its driest and most sun-scorched.

*   **Third Quarter (Jun 21 -> Sep 21): The Eagle's Quarter**
    *   **Why it works:** The constellation **Aquila** the Eagle soars high in the summer sky. The Eagle represents freedom, perspective, and resilience. It evokes the feeling of long, hot days and vast open skies in the North. For the South, it symbolizes the resilience required to endure the cold, and the freedom that comes with it.

*   **Fourth Quarter (Sep 21 -> Dec 21): The Water Bearer's Quarter**
    *   **Why it works:** The constellation **Aquarius** the Water Bearer rules this time. This figure brings the cleansing rains of autumn to the Northern Hemisphere. For many parts of the Southern Hemisphere, this period marks the end of the dry season and the arrival of life-giving rains, making the Water Bearer a universally welcome symbol of transition and renewal.
