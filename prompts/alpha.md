# Perpetual calendar

Please, review and expand.

I want to design a perpetual calendar:
1. 52 weeks (seven days long) plus 1 festive day (2 festive days in leap year)
3. 4 seasons (13 weeks per season): Summer is Calida, Autumn is Fructus, Winter is Frigida, Spring is Florea. 
4. Names of the days of the week related to heaven (the sun, the moon, the stars) and the common world (air, water, fire, and earth)
5. Additional days at leap year are very special days.

I want a picture per each season.
